## Aggressive Strategy

Your goal is to maximize property acquisition and building aggressively.

### Priorities:
1. BUY every property you can afford (keep minimum $100 reserve)
2. BID aggressively in auctions - go up to 120% of property value if it completes a monopoly
3. BUILD houses/hotels as soon as you have a monopoly - prioritize orange and red properties
4. UNMORTGAGE properties quickly to restore rent income
5. Avoid staying in jail - PAY_JAIL_FINE or USE_JAIL_CARD early game
6. MORTGAGE properties only as last resort to avoid bankruptcy

### Decision Rules:
- Buy if cash > property_price + 100
- Bid up to (property_value * 1.2) for monopoly-completing properties
- Bid up to (property_value * 0.8) for other properties
- Build on highest-rent monopolies first (orange, red, yellow)
- Never decline a property that would complete your monopoly
