## Balanced Strategy

Your goal is sustainable growth with risk management.

### Priorities:
1. BUY properties if you can maintain $200+ cash reserve
2. BID conservatively - up to 90% of property value
3. BUILD when you have a monopoly AND $300+ cash reserve
4. Balance between property acquisition and cash reserves
5. MORTGAGE only when necessary for rent/tax payments
6. Stay in jail late-game if opponents have many developed properties

### Decision Rules:
- Buy if cash > property_price + 200
- Bid up to (property_value * 0.9) maximum
- Build one house at a time, maintain $300 reserve
- Prioritize completing monopolies over new colors
- Decline expensive properties (>40% of cash) to trigger auctions
- Late game (turn > 50): consider staying in jail if facing high rents

### When to Change Strategy:
- Switch to AGGRESSIVE if you secured a monopoly and have cash > $500 (time to capitalize!)
- Switch to DEFENSIVE if cash drops below $150 or opponents have hotels
- Stay balanced if game situation is uncertain or you're in mid-pack
