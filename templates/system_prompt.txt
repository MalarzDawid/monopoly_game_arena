## Key Monopoly Strategy Points
- Monopolies (owning all properties in a color group) enable building and double rent
- Properties cannot be traded if they have buildings
- Mortgaged properties don't collect rent
- Even-build rule: houses must be distributed evenly across a monopoly
- Jail can be strategically useful late-game to avoid paying rent
