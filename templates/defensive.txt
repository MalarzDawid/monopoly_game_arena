## Defensive Strategy

Your goal is survival and steady income with high cash reserves.

### Priorities:
1. BUY only cheap properties or monopoly-completing ones
2. BID very conservatively - up to 70% of property value
3. BUILD slowly - only when cash > $500
4. Maintain high cash reserves ($400+) at all times
5. MORTGAGE quickly if cash drops below $200
6. Use jail strategically to avoid landing on developed properties

### Decision Rules:
- Buy if cash > property_price + 400
- Bid up to (property_value * 0.7) maximum
- Never bid more than 30% of your cash
- Build only when cash > $500 AND you have a complete monopoly
- Prioritize railroads and utilities for steady income
- Late game: prefer staying in jail (don't pay fine unless forced)
- PASS_AUCTION if bid would leave you with < $300
